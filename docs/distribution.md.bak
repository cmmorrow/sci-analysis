# Distribution

A [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) describes the spread and tendency of a collection of numeric data. In this case, the spread is the relative distance of a data point to the other data points. You can think of this as data points being grouped close to one another, or spread far apart from one another. A common measurement of this spread is [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance), which is the spread from the mean of a distribution.

[Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean) measures the central tendency of a distribution. Tendency refers to when data points "tend" to group closely to one another. This is easily calculated by summing all the values of the data points and dividing by the total number of data points **n**.

A distribution is represented on a graph by a [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram). A histogram charts a distribution by separating the numeric data in the distribution into discrete bins along the x-axis. These bins are charted as bars, where the height of each bar represents how many numeric values are in that bin.

A distribution represented by a histogram closely resembles a [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) for continuous numeric data, or a [probability mass function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function) for discrete numeric data.

## Interpreting the Graphs

The distribution analysis can show three graphs, the histogram, boxplot, and cumulative distribution plot. 

Let's first import sci-analysis and setup some variables to use in these examples.


```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as st
from sci_analysis import analyze

%matplotlib inline
```


```python
# Create sequence from random variables.
np.random.seed(987654321)
sequence = st.norm.rvs(2, 0.45, size=2000)
```

### Histogram

The histogram, as described above, separates numeric data into discrete bins along the x-axis. The y-axis is the probability that a data point from a given distribution will belong to a particular bin.


```python
analyze(
    sequence, 
    boxplot=False,
)
```

    Mean      =  2.0220

### Boxplot

Boxplots in sci-analysis are actually a hybrid of two distribution visualization techniques, the boxplot and the [violin plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot). Boxplots are a good way to quickly understand a distribution, but can be misleading when the distribution is [multimodal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_distribution). A violin plot does a much better job at showing local maxima and minima of a distribution.

In the center of each box is a red line and green triangle. The green triangle represents the mean of the group while the red line represents the median, sometimes referred to as the second quartile (Q2) or 50% line. The circles that might be seen at either end of the boxplot are outliers, and referred to as such because they are in the bottom 5% and top 95% of the distribution.


```python
analyze(sequence)
```

### Cumulative Distribution Function

The cumulative distribution function (cdf) differs from the probability density function in that it directly shows the probability of a data point occurring at a particular value in the distribution. The x-axis is the value in the distribution and the y-axis is the probability. For example, the center line of the y-axis is the 0.5 line (also known as the second quartile or Q2), and where the cdf crosses the 0.5 line is the median of the distribution.


```python
analyze(
    sequence, 
    boxplot=False, 
    cdf=True,
)
```

## Interpreting the Statistics

There are two types of data that accompany the distribution analysis -- the summary statistics and the test for normality. 

### Summary Statistics
* **n** - The number of data points in the analysis.
* **Mean** - The arithmetic mean or average of the analysis.
* **Std Dev** - The [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of the analysis.
* **Std Error** - The [standard error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error) of the analysis.
* **Skewness** - A measure of how [skewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) the distribution is towards the min or max.
* **Kurtosis** - The [kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis) is a measure of how peaky the distribution is.
* **Maximum** - The largest value in the distribution.
* **75%** - The third [quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) (Q3) of the distribution.
* **50%** - The second [quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) (Q2) or median of the distribution.
* **25%** - The first [quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) (Q1) of the distribution.
* **Minimum** - The smallest value in the distribution.
* **IQR** - The [interquartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range) range of the distribution, which is calculated by Q3 - Q1.
* **Range** - The range of the distribution measured by Maximum - Minimum.

### Test for normality

The [Shapiro-Wilk test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiroâ€“Wilk_test) attempts to determine if the distribution closely resembles the normal distribution. If the p value is less than or equal to alpha, the distribution is considered to not be normally distributed.
