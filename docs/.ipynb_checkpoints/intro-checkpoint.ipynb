    "sci-analysis is a python package for quickly performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). It aims to make performing EDA easier for newcomers and experienced data analysts alike by abstracting away the specific SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib commands. This is accomplished by using sci-analysis's ``analyze()`` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main features of sci-analysis are:\n",
    "* Fast EDA with the analyze() function.\n",
    "* Great looking graphs without writing several lines of matplotlib code.\n",
    "* Automatic use of the most appropriate hypothesis test for the supplied data.\n",
    "* Automatic handling of missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, sci-analysis is capable of performing four common statistical analysis techniques:\n",
    "* Histograms and summary of numeric data\n",
    "* Histograms and frequency of categorical data\n",
    "* Bivariate and linear regression analysis\n",
    "* Location testing"
