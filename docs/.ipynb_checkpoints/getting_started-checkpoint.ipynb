This is because the version of python that comes with your OS will require root permission to manage, might be changed when upgrading the OS, and can break your OS if critical packages are accidentally removed. More info on why the system python should not be used can be found here: https://github.com/MacPython/wiki/wiki/Which-Python\n",
